# ProjectandPortfolio3

This project is a full-stack web application that integrates with the Spotify API to authenticate users and eventually allow interaction with their Spotify data. The backend is built with Express and uses MongoDB for data storage. Ngrok is used for secure local development and OAuth testing. Environment variables are managed securely using a .env file.
